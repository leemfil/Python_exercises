Ask the player for their name, and once they type in their name present the next part of the welcome message.
Show a "graphical" representation of the kitchen cupboards (yes, we’re keeping it very, very simple here!)
Ask the player to guess where the goblin is hiding by typing in the number of the cupboard.
If the guess is incorrect, display a message and ask again.
If the guess is correct, display a winning message and end the game.
